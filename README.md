# StatisticsProject

## Overview
This project looks at how different factors affect sleep patterns. Using statistical methods like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and sampling distributions, we analyze data to find out what influences sleep quality and duration.

## Key Features
Hypothesis Testing: Tests to see if the relationships between sleep and factors like age, gender, and stress are significant.
Confidence Intervals: Estimates the range where the true values are likely to be.
Sampling Distribution: Examines how sample statistics vary and how reliable they are.
Data Visualization: Shows important trends and relationships with charts and graphs.
