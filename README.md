# StatisticsProject

## Overview
This project looks at how different factors affect sleep patterns. Using statistical methods like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and sampling distributions, we analyze data to find out what influences sleep quality and duration.

## Key Features

- **Hypothesis Testing**: Determines if relationships between sleep quality and factors like age, gender, and stress are statistically significant.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Estimates the range within which the true values are likely to fall.
- **Sampling Distribution**: Analyzes the variation in sample statistics and their reliability.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides charts and graphs to illustrate trends and relationships.
